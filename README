Packaging for Kodi

This set of tools intends to cover all build flavors of kodi,
such as x11 desktop PCs, framebuffer arm boards, raspberrypi ...

The actual debian source-package is generated using:
./make.sh <windowsystem> <gllibrary> <target>
all arguments are optional, however they need to be in this order.

Currently known window-systems are:
fb - Linux framebuffer (none)
x11 - X.org

GL libraries are
gl - Desktop OpenGL
gles - OpenGL-ES

build targets
generic - standard build for desktop PCs
imx - optimize for i.MX SoCs

The resulting files are:
kodi_VERSION.debian.tar.gz
kodi_VERSION.dsc

These can be used to build kodi using dpkg-buildpackage:
dpkg-source -x kodi_VERSION.dsc
cd kodi-VERSION
dpkg-buildpackage
